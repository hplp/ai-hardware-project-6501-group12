## Project Title: Dermoscopy/Skin Disease recognition powered by edge AI 

## Project Description:
The aim of this project is to develop a portable device for detecting skin diseases using AI-driven image classification models. 
Leveraging the Google Coral Dev Board Micro, this device will enable healthcare professionals to perform quick, reliable assessments in clinical settings.

## Key Objectives:
- Optimize current AI Model to classify skin disease with relatively high accuracy 
- Reduce model size and ensure the AI model runs efficiently on the Google Coral Dev Board Micro while maintaining high accuracy
- Test and validate the device with a dataset of skin images to assess reliability and accuracy.
- Compare accuracy and model size on skin detection

## Technology Stack:
Project Platform: Edge AI
Hardware Platform: Google Coral Dec Board Micro


## Expected Outcomes:
-Edge AI model that can detect skin diseases with reasonable accuracy and model size. 

## Timeline:
-1st week: find and familar with current dataset and AI model， Initial setup of Google Coral Dev Board Micro.
-2nd week: decrease the model size and integrate the model with the Coral Dev Board and perform preliminary tests on accuracy, speed, and functionality
-3rd week: Final Testing and Improvements: Fine-tune the model and device setup, implement any necessary adjustments, and validate the device’s accuracy with additional test data.
