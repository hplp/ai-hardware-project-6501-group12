## Project Title: Dermoscopy

## Project Description:
Dermoscopy, also known as dermatoscopy, examines skin lesions with a dermatoscope. 
A dermatoscope captures images or videos of the skin which can be used to analyze the skin diseases.
The ultimate goal of this project is to build an edge AI model that can detect skin diseases.

## Key Objectives:
- build Edge AI model 
- train Edge AI model to detect skin diseases using images
- Apply Edge AI model to hardware device
- Making Edge AI small and efficient
- Compare accuracy and model size on skin detection

## Technology Stack:
Project Platform: Edge AI
Hardware Platform: Google Coral Dec Board Micro


## Expected Outcomes:
-Edge AI model that can detect skin diseases with reasonable accuracy and model size. 

## Timeline:
-1st week: build and train AI model
-2nd week: decrease the model size so it can be run in a small hardware
-3rd week: test and evaluate
